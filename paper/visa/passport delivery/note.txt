==================================

If you applied online with an e-App, or if you received a request from CIC to submit your passport to the Visa Office, you can use the VAC to securely send your passport.
Step 1: Bring your passport to the VAC and pay the appropriate fee(s). Please include the letter from CIC requesting your passport, the VAC Consent Form, and your contact information, specifically your daytime telephone number and email address. You may either bring your passport in-person to the VAC or send it by courier.
The VAC will send your passport to the Visa Office and provide you with a tracking number so you can track where your passport is. The fee for the Passport delivery / e-Application service is $30.59. (Please note that it is not necessary to pay the VAC service charge in addition to this fee.)
Step 2: Decide how you want your passport returned to you. You can choose to retrieve your passport in person or have your passport delivered to you at home. If you choose to have it delivered, you must include a pre-paid Air Waybill when you submit your passport to the VAC.
FedEx Courier fees are offered at preferred rates and can only be paid directly at the VAC (see details below). FedEx prepaid AWBs will NOT be accepted by the VAC. You may also use USPS to mail your passport.

The fees can be paid by bank draft, cashier’s cheque, certified cheque, or money order directed to CSC Consular Services Inc. Personal checks are not accepted. Your payment (draft, check, etc.) must be sent to the following lockbox and you must send a copy of the payment along with your application to the VAC. NOTE: do not send your application or any supporting documents to the lockbox; only mail your payment.
