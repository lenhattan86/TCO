% At a minimum you need to supply the author names, year and a title.
% IMPORTANT:
% Full first names whenever they are known, surname last, followed by a period.
% In the case of two authors, 'and' is placed between them.
% In the case of three or more authors, the serial comma is used, that is, all author names
% except the last one but including the penultimate author's name are followed by a comma,
% and then 'and' is placed before the final author's name.
% If only first and middle initials are known, then each initial
% is followed by a period and they are separated by a space.
% The remaining information (journal title, volume, article number, date, etc.) is 'auto-generated'.
